# Attack Path OSINT Playbook

I started writing this after finding exposed infrastructure on an institution's network using nothing but Google and some security testing.

No exploits. No tools. Just search operators and the right questions.

Most public exposure isn't hidden behind exploits.
It's sitting in PDFs, cached pages, forgotten subdomains, old resumes, or metadata nobody thought to remove.

That made me think — if I could map this much from a browser tab, what does a real attacker see before they ever touch a target? This repo is basically the result of chasing that question.

This repository focuses on practical OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), passive reconnaissance, attack-path analysis, Google dorking, metadata analysis, identity correlation, infrastructure mapping, and defensive exposure assessment from both red-team and blue-team perspectives.

## What this is

A field guide built around one idea: **OSINT is not a tool problem, it's a thinking problem.**

Most guides hand you a list of commands and call it a methodology. This one works the other way — every section starts with the analyst question, builds the attack path, then references tools at the end as execution aids.

Every offensive section has a defensive mirror. Because if you understand how something is found, you understand how to stop it from being found.

## Why I built it this way

I've gone through enough OSINT resources that start with "install theHarvester" and end with a wall of dork queries. They're fine as references. They don't teach you to think.

The questions that actually matter during an investigation are:

- What am I looking for, and why would it exist publicly?
- Is this signal or noise?
- When do I go deeper? When do I pivot? When do I stop?

Those questions don't appear in most guides. They're in every section of this one.

## Who this is for

- People learning OSINT beyond just tool usage
- SOC analysts and threat hunters
- Red teamers doing passive reconnaissance
- Blue teamers validating public exposure
- Security researchers and investigators
- Anyone curious how attackers build attack paths from public data

Start with 01 — [Analyst Framework](./modules/01-analyst-framework.md).
Everything after that builds on it.

## The pivot chain that started this

```
Phone number
  → UPI lookup → bank-verified legal name
  → LinkedIn → employer → email pattern
  → Breach data → password reuse → username
  → Sherlock → old accounts → profile photo
  → Yandex → older accounts → deeper data
```

Each step is passive. Each step uses only public data. That was the moment I realized most people have no clue how exposed they actually are online.

## A few things worth mentioning

**It's India-grounded.** UPI name lookups, Truecaller chains, JustDial and IndiaMart dorks, DPDP Act 2023 framing. Not a recycled Western playbook.

**The case study is real.** Found exposed infrastructure on my college network through passive recon. Documented it, reported it responsibly, wrote it up as a full walkthrough. It's in module 14.

**Blue team is not an afterthought.** Every module has a detection and hardening table. I work in MDR context so the defensive side matters as much as the offensive side to me.
