# OSINT Playbook

I started writing this after finding exposed infrastructure on my own college network using nothing but Google.
No exploits. No tools. Just search operators and the right questions.
That made me think — if I could map this much from a browser tab, what does a real attacker see before they ever touch a target? This playbook is my attempt to answer that properly.

What this is
A field guide built around one idea: OSINT is not a tool problem, it's a thinking problem.
Most guides hand you a list of commands and call it a methodology. This one works the other way — every section starts with the analyst question, builds the attack path, then references tools at the end as execution aids.
Every offensive technique is paired with its defensive equivalent. Because if you understand how something is found, you understand how to stop it from being found.

Why I built it this way
I've gone through enough OSINT resources that start with "install theHarvester" and end with a wall of dork queries. They're fine as references. They don't teach you to think.
The questions that actually matter during an investigation are:

What am I looking for, and why would it exist publicly?
Is this signal or noise?
When do I go deeper? When do I pivot? When do I stop?

Those questions don't appear in most guides. They're in every section of this one.

Start with 01 — Analyst Framework. Every module that follows operates inside that framework. Techniques without a framework produce noise.

## What Makes This Different

**Method-driven, not tool-driven.**  
Every section leads with the analyst workflow and attack path model. Tools are referenced at the end of each section as execution aids — not the starting point.

**Blue team paired with every offensive technique.**  
Each module includes a detection and hardening table. Understanding how to find things is only half the picture.

**India-specific grounding.**  
UPI name lookup chains, Truecaller, JustDial/Indiamart dorks, and DPDP Act 2023 framing — not just a recycled Western playbook.

**Pivot-chain focused.**  
Every section is built around the question: *what does this data connect to next?*

```
Phone → Legal Name (UPI) → LinkedIn → Email Pattern
     → Breach Data → Username → Cross-Platform Accounts
     → Profile Photo → Reverse Image → Older Accounts
```

A few things worth mentioning
It's India-grounded. UPI name lookups, Truecaller chains, JustDial and IndiaMart dorks, DPDP Act 2023 framing. Not a recycled Western playbook.
The case study is real. Found exposed infrastructure on my college network through passive recon. Documented it, reported it responsibly, wrote it up as a full walkthrough. It's in module 14.
Blue team is not an afterthought. Every module has a detection and hardening table. I work in MDR context so the defensive side matters as much as the offensive side to me.
