# OSINT Playbook

> A practitioner's field guide to Open Source Intelligence — method-driven, analyst-focused, tools come last.

**Focus:** Attack Surface Management, Corporate Recon, Identity Enumeration  
**Framing:** Every offensive technique paired with its defensive detection equivalent

---

## Philosophy

Most OSINT guides hand you a tool list and call it a framework.

This is different.

Before touching a single tool or search query, an analyst needs to know:

- What am I looking for, and why would it exist publicly?
- How do I classify signal vs. noise?
- When do I go deeper? When do I pivot? When do I stop?

**Tools come last. Thinking comes first.**

Every section in this playbook is an execution layer within a structured analyst framework — built around attack paths, pivot chains, and decision logic. Not checklists.

## Start Here

**→ [01 — Analyst Framework](./modules/01-analyst-framework.md)**

This is the brain of the playbook. Read it before anything else. Every module that follows operates inside this framework.

> Techniques without a framework produce noise.

## What Makes This Different

**Method-driven, not tool-driven.**  
Every section leads with the analyst workflow and attack path model. Tools are referenced at the end of each section as execution aids — not the starting point.

**Blue team paired with every offensive technique.**  
Each module includes a detection and hardening table. Understanding how to find things is only half the picture.

**India-specific grounding.**  
UPI name lookup chains, Truecaller, JustDial/Indiamart dorks, and DPDP Act 2023 framing — not just a recycled Western playbook.

**Pivot-chain focused.**  
Every section is built around the question: *what does this data connect to next?*

```
Phone → Legal Name (UPI) → LinkedIn → Email Pattern
     → Breach Data → Username → Cross-Platform Accounts
     → Profile Photo → Reverse Image → Older Accounts
```

## Legal and Ethical Boundaries

- All techniques operate on **publicly available data only**
- Active exploitation is **out of scope** — this is passive recon methodology
- Always obtain **written authorization** before running OSINT against an organization
- Responsible disclosure is mandatory when findings affect real systems
- Governed by applicable law — **India: IT Act 2000, DPDP Act 2023**
